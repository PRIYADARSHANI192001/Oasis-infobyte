TASK 1

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics, commonly used for classification tasks. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features:

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
The dataset includes three species of iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each species has 50 samples. The Iris dataset is often used to demonstrate various machine learning algorithms, especially for classification and clustering.
