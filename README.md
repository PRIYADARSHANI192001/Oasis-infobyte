TASK 1

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics, commonly used for classification tasks. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features:

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
The dataset includes three species of iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each species has 50 samples. The Iris dataset is often used to demonstrate various machine learning algorithms, especially for classification and clustering.

TASK 2

Unemployment Analysis focuses on exploring and analyzing unemployment data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to joblessness. It typically involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to illustrate factors influencing unemployment rates. The kernel may also include statistical analyses or predictive modeling to understand the relationships between various economic indicators and unemployment. This resource is valuable for those interested in labor economics, data visualization, and the social implications of unemployment trends.

TASK 3


A Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts. They have contracted an automobile consulting company to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market.

TASK 4

Spam or Ham EDA & SMS Classification" focuses on analyzing and classifying SMS messages as either spam or legitimate (ham). The kernel typically includes an exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase to visualize and understand the dataset, uncovering patterns and features that distinguish spam from ham messages. It likely employs various machine learning algorithms for classification, showcasing techniques like data preprocessing, vectorization of text data, and model evaluation metrics to assess performance.

TASK 5

Sales Prediction typically focuses on using historical sales data to develop predictive models. It likely involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of machine learning algorithms to forecast future sales. The kernel may showcase techniques such as feature engineering, model evaluation, and optimization to improve prediction accuracy, making it a valuable resource for those interested in data science and retail analytics.
